281	Carotenoids	LD	adult		good				212	Natl Academy DRI	There are no DRIs specifically for carotenoids. The most prevalent carotenoids in North American diets are a-carotene, b-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-cryptoxanthin. Of these, a-carotene, b-carotene, and b- cryptoxanthin can be converted into retinol (vitamin A) in the body and are called provitamin A carotenoids. Lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin have no vi- tamin A activity and are called nonprovitamin A carotenoids. The only known function of carotenoids in humans is to act as a source of vitamin A in the diet (provitamin A carotenoids only). Although epidemiological evidence suggests that higher blood concentrations of b-carotene and other carotenoids obtained from foods are associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases, other evidence suggests possible harm arising from very large doses in population subgroups, such as smokers and asbestos workers. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that a certain percentage of dietary vitamin A should come from provitamin A carot- enoids. However, existing recommendations calling for the increased consump- tion of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables for their health-promoting benefits are strongly supported.
