* **EAR**   -- **Estimated Average Requirement**: The average daily nutrient intake level that is estimated to _meet the requirements of half of the healthy individuals_ in a particular life stage and gender group.
* **RDA**   -- **Recommended Dietary Allowance**: The average daily dietary nutrient intake level that is sufficient to _meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all_ (97–98 percent) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group. Derived from the EAR as RDA = EAR + 2*sigma (i.e. two standard deviations)
* **AI**    -- **Adequate Intake**: The recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people that are _assumed to be adequate; used when an RDA cannot be determined_.
* **UL**    -- **Tolerable Upper Intake Level**: The _highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk_ of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase.
* **AMDR** -- **Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges**: the range of intakes of an energy source that is associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease, yet can provide adequate amounts of essential nutrients; expressed as a percentage of total energy intake.

Also:

* RNI  -- Canada's Recommended Nutrient Intakes

* EER   -- In the case of energy, an Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) is provided. The EER is the average dietary energy intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in a healthy adult of a defined age, gender, weight, height, and level of physical activity consistent with good health. In children and pregnant and lactating women, the EER is taken to include the needs associated with the deposition of tissues or the secretion of milk at rates consistent with good health.

Excessive physical activity can lead to the following adverse effects:

• Overuse injuries: Too much or improper physical exercise can cause over- use injuries to muscles, bones, and joints, as well as injuries caused by accidents. In addition, pre-existing conditions can be aggravated by the initiation of a physical activity program. Activity-related injuries are of- ten avoidable but do occur and need to be resolved in the interest of long-term general health and short-term physical fitness.
• Dehydration and hyperthermia: Exercise may cause dehydration, which can be aggravated by environmental conditions that increase fluid losses, such as heat, humidity, and lack of wind. People should consume water before, during (if possible), and after exercise.
• Hypothermia: Hypothermia can result from water exposure and heat loss during winter sports. Poor choice of clothing during skiing, accidental water immersion due to a capsized boat, weather changes, or physical exhaustion may lead to the inability to generate adequate body heat to maintain core body temperature, which can lead to death, even when temperatures are above freezing.
• Cardiac events: Although regular physical activity promotes cardiovas- cular fitness, heavy physical exertion can trigger the development of arrhythmias or myocardial infarctions or, in some instances, can lead to sudden death.
• Female athlete triad: Athletic women who undereat or overtrain can de- velop a condition, or cluster of conditions, called the “female athlete triad.” In this triad, disordered eating and chronic energy deficits can lead to loss of menses, osteopenia, and premature osteoporosis, increas- ing the risk of hip, spine, and forearm fractures.

INADEQUATE INTAKE AND DEFICIENCY: In Western urban societies, one particular concern is the long-term effect of a diet so low in carbohydrate that it induces a chronically increased produc- tion of keto acids. Such a diet may lead to bone mineral loss, hypercholester- olemia, increased risk of urolithiasis, and impaired development and function of the central nervous system. It also may adversely affect a person’s sense of well-being and fail to provide adequate glycogen stores. The latter is required for hypoglycemic emergencies and for maximal short-term power production by muscles.
ADVERSE EFFECTS OF OVERCONSUMPTION: Data are mixed on potential adverse effects of overconsuming carbohydrate (i.e., sugars and starches), which include dental caries, behavioral changes, can- cer, risk of obesity, and risk of hyperlipidemia. For more information on the association between carbohydrates and chronic disease, see Part II, “Macronu- trients, Healthful Diets, and Physical Activity.”

Fatty acids are the major constituents of triglycerides and fall into the following categories:

* **saturated fatty acids**
* **cis monounsaturated fatty acids**
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6**
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3**
* **trans fatty acids**

* **Monounsaturated fatty acids (n-9)** -- AI -- can be synthesized by the body and confer no known independent health benefits. Neither an EAR (and thus an RDA) nor an AI was set. Evidence was insufficient to set a UL for cis monounsaturated fatty acids.
* **Trans fatty acids** -- AI -- are not essential and confer no known health benefits. Therefore, no EAR (and thus an RDA) or AI was set. As with saturated fatty acids, there is a positive linear trend between trans fatty acid intake and LDL cholesterol concentration and therefore an increased risk of coronary heart dis- eases. It is recommended that individuals maintain their trans fatty acid con- sumption as low as possible without compromising the nutritional adequacy of their diet. Foods that contain trans fatty acids include traditional stick marga- rine and vegetable shortenings subjected to partial hydrogenation and various bakery products and fried foods prepared using partially hydrogenated oils. Milk, butter, and meats also contain trans fatty acids but at lower levels

* **Total Fat** -- Interactions -- fat aids in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K, and other food components, such as carotenoids.

* **Saturated fatty acids** -- No UL, but as low as possible while following a nutritionally adequate diet.
* **Trans fatty acids** -- No UL, but as low as possible while following a nutritionally adequate diet.
* **cis monounsaturated fatty acids** -- No UL
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6** -- No UL
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3** -- No UL

* **Total Fat** -- Inadequate -- In sedentary populations, such as those in the United States and Canada where overweight and obesity are common, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets induce changes in lipoprotein and glucose/insulin metabolism in ways that could raise the risk for chronic diseases. Available prospective studies have not concluded whether high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets present a health risk in the North American population. Imbalanced intake can also be of concern. Compared with higher fat diets, low-fat and high-carbohydrate diets may alter metabolism in a way that in- creases the risk of chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease and diabetes. These changes include a reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) choles- terol concentration, an increase in serum triacylglycerol concentration, and higher responses in glucose and insulin concentrations following food consumption. This metabolic pattern has been associated with an increased risk of CHD and Type II diabetes, although strong evidence does not exist that low-fat diets actu- ally predispose an individual to either CHD or diabetes.
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6** -- When n-6 fatty acid intake is inadequate or absorption is impaired, tissue concentrations of arachidonic acid decrease, inhibition of the desaturation of oleic acid is reduced, and synthesis of eicosatrienoic acid from oleic acid in- creases. A lack of dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is characterized by rough scaly skin, dermatitis, and an elevated eicosatrienoic acid:arachidonic acid (triene:tetraene) ratio.
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3** -- Inadequate -- A lack of a-linolenic acid in the diet can result in clinical symptoms of a defi- ciency (e.g., scaly dermatitis). Unlike essential fatty acid deficiency (of both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids), plasma eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 n-9) remains within nor- mal ranges, and skin atrophy and scaly dermatitis are absent when the diet is only deficient in n-3 fatty acids.
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3** -- Benefits -- Because of their function, growing evidence suggests that dietary n-3 poly- unsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) may reduce the risk of many chronic diseases including CHD, stroke, and diabetes. For example, n-3 fatty acids may reduce CHD risk through a variety of mechanisms, such as by preventing arrhythmias, reducing atherosclerosis, decreasing platelet aggregation and plasma triacylglycerol concentration, slightly increasing HDL concentration, modulat- ing endothelial function, and decreasing proinflammatory eicosanoids.

> Special Considerations p 136

### Cholesterol p 137

Neither an EAR, RDA, nor AI was set for cholesterol.
Because all tissues are capable of synthesizing enough cholesterol to meet their metabolic and structural needs, there is no evidence for a biological requirement for dietary cholesterol.
It is recommended that people maintain their dietary cholesterol intake as low as possible, while consuming a diet nutritionally adequate in all required nutrients.
The main adverse effect of dietary cholesterol is increased LDL cholesterol concentration, which could result in an increased risk of CHD.
There is also increasing evidence that genetic factors underlie a substantial portion of the variation among individuals in response to dietary cholesterol. Although mixed, there is evidence that increases in serum cholesterol concen- tration due to dietary cholesterol are blunted by diets low in saturated fat, high in polyunsaturated fat, or both.
No consistent significant associations have been established between dietary cholesterol intake and cancer, including lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers.

No UL for proteins

### Amino Acids p 149

The recommended amino acid scoring pattern for proteins for individuals aged 1 year and older and all other age groups is as shown (in mg/g of protein). This pattern allows comparison of the relative nutritional quality of different protein sources by calculating a pro- tein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). The calculation com- pares the amino acid in a test protein with the amount of that amino acid in the FNB/IOM scoring pattern multiplied by the true digestibility. Illustration of the calculation involved is detailed in Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohy- drate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (2005).

* isoleucine		      	25 mg per g_protein
* leucine		      	55 mg per g_protein
* lysine		      	51 mg per g_protein
* methionine + cysteine (SAA)	25 mg per g_protein
* phenylalanine + tyrosine   	47 mg per g_protein
* threonine		      	27 mg per g_protein
* tryptophan		      	 7 mg per g_protein
* valine		      	32 mg per g_protein
* histidine     	      	18 mg per g_protein

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein is

Protein		AMDR	child_14_18	10–30 percent of total calories
Protein		AMDR	adult_18_up	10–35 percent of total calories

* The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects for almost all people. Data were insufficient to establish a UL for total protein or for any of the amino acids.
* However, the absence of a UL warrants caution in using any single amino acid at levels significantly above those normally found in food.

* Given limited data, caution is warranted in using any single amino acid at a level significantly above that normally found in food.

* Active adults: Physical activity, particularly when performed in hot weather, increases daily fluid needs. Daily water requirements for adults can double in hot weather (86∞F or 30∞C) and triple in very hot weather (104∞F or 40∞C) to make up for water lost via sweating.
* Active children: Children who are active produce considerably less sweat than active adults, even when exercising in hot environments. This dif- ference in sweat production prevails until midpuberty and should be considered when determining the water requirements of active children and adolescents.
* Elderly: Hydration status continues to be normal in elderly individuals over a wide range of intakes. However, a deficit in thirst and fluid intake regulation, age-related impairments in renal-concentrating and sodium- conserving ability, prior history of stroke, or evidence of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction may contribute to increased incidence of dehy- dration and hypernatremia.

* People in very hot (e.g., desert) climates, who often have sweating rates of 0.3–1.2 L/hour while performing occupational activities
* People wearing protective clothing, who often have sweating rates of 1–2 L/hour while performing light-intensity exercise in hot weather
* Male competitive runners, who can have sweating rates of 1 to > 2 L/hour while training or racing in the heat
* Female competitive runners may increase their sweat losses from approximately 0.7 L/hour in temperate weather to approximately 1.1 L/hour in warm weather when performing the same event

* Diabetes mellitus: Dehydration is clearly associated with the worsening control of diabetes. In addition, uncontrolled diabetes dramatically contributes to de- velopment of severe dehydration and volume depletion due to osmotic diure- sis. In people with poorly controlled diabetes, reduced water intake can also lead to dehydration owing to infection or hypotension, which can lead to de- lirium and an impaired ability to seek water.
* Cystic fibrosis: People with cystic fibrosis have high concentrations of sodium chloride in their sweat. They may lose excessive amounts of sodium and chlo- ride when their sweating rates are high and, unlike healthy people, their body fluid osmolality does not increase due to the high concentrations of sodium chloride in their sweat. Without elevated serum osmolality, a major trigger for thirst, cystic fibrosis patients can quickly become dehydrated during physical activity, particularly in the heat.
* Diuretics and other medications: There are no medications that directly stimu- late water intake. When decreased fluid intake has occurred due to illness, medications that improve metabolic and cognitive function should indirectly help people increase their fluid intake. Examples include antibiotics for infec- tions, insulin for unstable diabetics, and analgesics for delirium-inducing pain. However, some drugs, such as diuretics, cause excess water loss. Diuretics are commonly used medications that are prescribed for the treatment of condi- tions such as hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Dehy- dration may occur in people who do not modify their use of diuretics in hot weather or in other situations where excess water loss occurs. Other medica- tions, such as lithium, may interfere with the kidneys’ regulatory systems, lead- ing to excessive water loss.

Because healthy individuals have considerable ability to excrete excess water and thereby maintain water balance, a UL was not set for water. However, acute water toxicity has been reported from the rapid consumption of large quantities of fluids that greatly exceeded the kidneys’ maximal excretion rate of approxi- mately 0.7–1.0 L/hour.
No adverse intakes have been reported with chronic high intakes of water in health people consuming a normal diet, as long as fluid intake is approximately proportional to losses.

Total Water -- Inadequate -- Inadequate water intake leads to dehydration

Total Water -- interaction -- Caffeine -- Due to its diuretic effect, caffeine in high amounts may lead to a total body water (TBW) deficit.
Total Water -- interaction -- Alcohol -- Alcohol intake appears to increase water excretion.
Total Water -- interaction -- Sodium -- Increased sodium intake may increase urine volume.
Total Water -- interaction -- Protein -- Increased protein consumption may increase water needs. Urea, a major end product of the metabolism of dietary proteins and amino acids, requires water for excretion by the kidneys.
Total Water -- interaction -- Fiber -- Fecal water loss is increased with increased dietary fiber.
Total Water -- interaction -- Carbohydrate -- The presence of dietary carbohydrates may decrease quantity of body solutes (ketone bodies) that need to be excreted

### Vitamin A p 171

* RAE = Retinol activity equivalent. 1 mg RAE = 1 mg retinol, 12 mg b-carotene, and 24 mg a-carotene or b-cryptoxanthin. The RAE for dietary provitamin A carotenoids in foods is twofold greater than retinol equivalents (RE), whereas the RAE for preformed vitamin A in foods is the same as RE.
* The UL for vitamin A applies only to preformed vitamin A (e.g., retinol, the form of vitamin A found in animal foods, most fortified foods, and supplements). It does not apply to vitamin A derived from carotenoids.

* Vitamin A -- Considerations -- Vegetarian diets: Preformed vitamin A (retinol) is found only in animal-based foods. People who do not consume such foods must meet their requirements with foods that contain sufficient provitamin A carotenoids, such as deeply colored fruits and vegetables, or with fortified foods, such as margarine, some plant-based beverages, and cereals.

* The UL for adults is based on liver abnormalities as the critical adverse effect; for women of childbearing age, the UL is based on teratogenicity as the critical adverse effect. High b-carotene in- takes have not been shown to cause hypervitaminosis A.

* Biotin content has been documented for relatively few foods, and so it is gener- ally not included in food composition tables. Thus, intake tends to be underestimated in diets. Although biotin is widely distributed in natural foods, its con- centration significantly varies. For example, liver contains biotin at about 100 mg/100 g, whereas fruits and most meats contain only about 1 mg/100 g.

### CAROTENOIDS p 212

he most prevalent carotenoids in North American diets are a-carotene, b-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-cryptoxanthin. Of these, a-carotene, b-carotene, and b- cryptoxanthin can be converted into retinol (vitamin A) in the body and are called provitamin A carotenoids. Lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin have no vi- tamin A activity and are called nonprovitamin A carotenoids. The only known function of carotenoids in humans is to act as a source of vitamin A in the diet (provitamin A carotenoids only).

There are no DRIs specifically for carotenoids

Al- though epidemiological evidence suggests that higher blood concentrations of b-carotene and other carotenoids obtained from foods are associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases, other evidence suggests possible harm arising from very large doses in population subgroups, such as smokers and asbestos workers. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that a certain percentage of dietary vitamin A should come from provitamin A carot- enoids. However, existing recommendations calling for the increased consump- tion of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables for their health-promoting benefits are strongly supported.

### Folate p 244

Folate is a B vitamin that functions as a coenzyme in the metabolism of nucleic and amino acids. Folate is a generic term that includes both the naturally occurring form of the vitamin (food folate or pteroyl- polyglutamates) and the monoglutamate form (folic acid or pteroylmonoglutamic acid), which is used in fortified foods and dietary supplements.
