* **EAR**   -- **Estimated Average Requirement**: The average daily nutrient intake level that is estimated to _meet the requirements of half of the healthy individuals_ in a particular life stage and gender group.
* **RDA**   -- **Recommended Dietary Allowance**: The average daily dietary nutrient intake level that is sufficient to _meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all_ (97–98 percent) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group. Derived from the EAR as RDA = EAR + 2*sigma (i.e. two standard deviations)
* **AI**    -- **Adequate Intake**: The recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people that are _assumed to be adequate; used when an RDA cannot be determined_.
* **UL**    -- **Tolerable Upper Intake Level**: The _highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk_ of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase.
* **AMDR** -- **Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges**: the range of intakes of an energy source that is associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease, yet can provide adequate amounts of essential nutrients; expressed as a percentage of total energy intake.

Also:

* RNI  -- Canada's Recommended Nutrient Intakes

* EER   -- In the case of energy, an Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) is provided. The EER is the average dietary energy intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in a healthy adult of a defined age, gender, weight, height, and level of physical activity consistent with good health. In children and pregnant and lactating women, the EER is taken to include the needs associated with the deposition of tissues or the secretion of milk at rates consistent with good health.

Vitamin A	-- Typical Intake -- -- p176 -- Based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1994–1996), the highest median intake of preformed vitamin A for any gender and life stage group was 895 mg/day for lactating women. The highest reported intake at the 95th percentile was 1,503 mg/day for lactating women. For U.S. adults who took supplements containing vitamin A, intakes at the 95th percentile ranged from approximately 1,500 to 3,000 mg/ day. Fewer than 5 percent of pregnant women had dietary and supplemental intake levels that exceeded the UL. The risk of exceeding the UL for vitamin A appears to be small based on the intakes cited above.
Vitamin B-6	-- Typical Intake -- -- p185 -- Based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994), 9 mg/day was the highest mean intake of vitamin B6 from food and supplements reported for any life stage and gender group. The highest reported intake at the 95th percentile was 21 mg/day in pregnant females aged 14 through 55 years, most of which was pyridoxine from supplements. The risk of adverse effects resulting from excess intake of vitamin B6 from food and supplements appears to be very low at these intake levels.
Vitamin B-12	-- Typical Intake -- -- p192 -- Based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994), the highest median intake of B12 from diet and supplements for any life stage and gender group was 17 mg/day; the highest reported intake at the 95th percentile was 37 mg/day. Furthermore, there appear to be no risks associated with intakes from supplemental B12 that are more than two orders of magnitude higher than the 95th percentile intake. However, this does not mean that there is no potential for adverse effects to occur with high intakes.
Total Water	-- Typical Intake -- -- p163 -- According to NHANES III (1988–1994), the highest total water intake (99th percentile) reported was 8.1 L/day. No adverse intakes have been reported with chronic high intakes of water in health people consuming a normal diet, as long as fluid intake is approximately proportional to losses.
Vitamin K	-- Typical Intake -- -- p258 -- According to data from NHANES III, median intakes of vitamin K from food and supplements were 93–119 μg/day for men and 82–90 mg/day for women (for those who reported consuming supplements).
Chromium	-- Typical Intake -- -- p299 -- According to U.S. data from the 1986 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 8 percent of adults consumed supplements that contained chromium. Based on data from NHANES III, the median supplemental intake of chromium was 23 mg/day for those who took supplements, an amount similar to the average di- etary chromium intake.
Copper	-- Typical Intake -- -- p308 -- According to U.S. data from the 1986 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) approximately 15 percent of adults in the United States consumed supplements that contained copper. Based on data from the NHANES III, the median dietary plus supplemental copper intake was similar to the intake from food alone. The mean intake of dietary and supplemental copper (1.3–2.2 mg/day) was ap- proximately 0.3–0.5 mg/day greater for men and women than the mean intake from food (1.0–1.7 mg/day). Based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994), the highest median intakes of copper from the diet and supplements for any gender and life stage group were approxi- mately 1,700 mg/day for men aged 19 through 50 years and approximately 1,900 mg/day for lactating women. The highest reported intake from food and supplements at the 99th percentile was 4,700 mg/day, also in lactating women. The next highest reported intake at the 99th percentile was 4,600 mg/day in pregnant women and men aged 50 through 70 years. The risk of adverse effects resulting from excess intake of copper from food, water, and supplements ap- pears to be low in the highest intakes noted above.
Iodine	-- Typical Intake -- -- p324 -- According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994), the median intake of iodine from supplements was approximately 140 mg/day for adults. The 1986 National Health Interview Sur- vey (NHIS) reported that approximately 12 percent of men and 15 percent of nonpregnant women took a supplement that contained iodine.
Iron	-- Typical Intake -- -- p334 -- The 1986 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) reported that approximately 21–25 percent of women and 16 percent of men consumed a supplement con- taining iron. According to NHANES III, the median intake of iron from supple- ments was approximately 1 mg/day for men and women. The median iron in- take from food plus supplements by pregnant women was approximately 21 mg/day. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994), the highest intake from food and supplements at the 90th percentile reported for any life stage and gender groups, excluding pregnancy and lactation, was approximately 34 mg/day for men 51 years of age and older. This value is below the UL of 45 mg/day. Between 50 and 75 percent of pregnant and lactating women consumed iron from food and supplements at a greater level than 45 mg/day, but iron supplementation is usually supervised in prenatal and postnatal care programs. Based on a UL of 45 mg/day of iron for adults, the risk of adverse effects from dietary sources appears to be low.
Manganese	-- Typical Intake -- -- p353 -- According to U.S. data from the 1986 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 12 percent of adults consumed supplements that contained manganese. Based on data from NHANES III, the median supplemental intake of manganese was 2.4 mg/day for those adults who took supplements, an amount similar to the average dietary manganese intake. Based on the Total Diet Study, the highest dietary manganese intake at the 95th percentile was 6.3 mg/day, which was the level consumed by men aged 31 to 50 years. Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994) indicated that the highest supplemental in- take of manganese at the 95th percentile was approximately 5 mg/day, which was consumed by adults, including pregnant women. The risk of an adverse effect resulting from excess intake of manganese from food and supplements appears to be low at these intakes.
Molybdenum	-- Typical Intake -- -- p359 -- Data available from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994) indicate that the average U.S. intakes from molybdenum supplements at the 95th percentile were 80 mg/day for men and 84 mg/day for women. Because there was no information from national surveys on percentile distribution of molybdenum intakes, the risk of adverse effects could not be characterized. Data from NHANES III indicated that the median intakes of molybdenum from supplements were 23 mg/day for men and 24 mg/day for women.
Sodium	-- Typical Intake -- -- p390 -- Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994) indicated that more than 95 percent of men and 75 percent of women in the United States consumed sodium chloride in excess of the UL. According to NHANES III, 24.7 percent of men and 24.3 percent of women aged 18 years and older had hypertension, indicating that a substantial number of individuals appear to experience this adverse effect. Data on Canadian consumption indicated that 90–95 percent of younger men (aged 19 to 50 years) and between 50 and 75 percent of younger women in the same age range had usual intakes above the UL. Neither of these surveys included discretionary salt usage (e.g., from the salt shaker).
Zinc	-- Typical Intake -- -- p406 -- According to data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examina- tion Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994), the highest reported zinc intake (from food) at the 95th percentile for all adults was 24 mg/day in men aged 19 to 30 years, which is lower than the UL. The 95th percentile of intake from food and supplements for adult men and nonpregnant women was approximately 25–32 mg/day; for pregnant and lactating women the 95th percentile of intake was 40 mg/day and 47 mg/day, respectively. The risk of adverse effects resulting from excess zinc intake appears to be low at these intake levels.
Arsenic		-- Typical Intake -- -- p420 -- This information was not provided at the time the DRI values for this nutrient were set.
Boron		-- Typical Intake -- -- p420 -- In NHANES III, the adult median intake of boron from supplements was approximately 0.14 mg/day. According to data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examina- tion Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994) at the 95th percentile, intake of boron from the diet and supplements was approximately 2.8 mg/day. Adding to that a maximum intake from water of 2 mg/day provides a total intake of less then 5 mg/day of boron at this percentile. At the 95th percentile intake, no segment of the U.S. population had a total (dietary, water, and supplemental) intake greater than 5 mg/day, according to NHANES III and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII, 1994–1996) data. Those who take body-build- ing supplements could consume an additional 1.5–20 mg/day. Therefore, this supplemental intake may exceed the UL of 20 mg/day.
Nickel		-- Typical Intake -- -- p420 -- In NHANES III, the adult median intake of nickel from supplements was approximately 5 μg/day. Based on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Total Diet Study (1991–1997), 0.5 mg/day was the highest intake at the 99th percentile of nickel (from food) reported for any life stage and gender group; this was also the reported intake for pregnant females. Nickel intake from supplements provided only 9.6–15 mg/day at the 99th percentile for all age and gender groups, accord- ing to NHANES III. The risk of adverse effects resulting from excess intake of nickel from food and supplements appears to be very low at the highest intakes noted above. Increased risks are likely to occur from environmental exposures or from the consumption of contaminated water.
Silicon		-- Typical Intake -- -- p420 -- In NHANES III, the adult median intake of silicon from supplements was approximately 2 mg/day.
Vanadium	-- Typical Intake -- -- p420 -- In NHANES III, the adult median intake of vanadium from supple- ments was approximately 9 μg/day.

Arsenic  -- Typical Adult Intake -- Not provided at the time the DRI values for this nutrient were set.
Boron:	 -- Typical Adult Intake -- NHANES III median intake from supplements -- 0.14 mg/day.
Nickel:	 -- Typical Adult Intake -- NHANES III median intake from supplements -- 5 μg/day.
Silicon: -- Typical Adult Intake -- NHANES III median intake from supplements -- 2 mg/day.
Vanadium -- Typical Adult Intake -- NHANES III median intake from supplements -- 9 μg/day.

### Notes


Folate	Note	Folate is a B vitamin that functions as a coenzyme in the metabolism of nucleic and amino acids. Folate is a generic term that includes both the naturally occurring form of the vitamin (food folate or pteroyl- polyglutamates) and the monoglutamate form (folic acid or pteroylmonoglutamic acid), which is used in fortified foods and dietary supplements.
Nickel	Note	The possible nutritional importance or biochemical function of nickel in humans has not been established. Nickel may serve as a cofactor or struc- tural component of specific metalloenzymes of various functions, including hy- drolysis and redox reactions and gene expression. Nickel may also serve as a cofactor facilitating iron absorption or metabolism.
Vanadium	Note	A functional role for vanadium in humans has not been identified. There are some reports that vanadium may increase the action of insulin, but the potential mechanism of action is uncertain. Vanadium also stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation and inhibits various ATPases, phosphatases, and phosphoryl-transfer enzymes.

Boron	Note	A collective body of evidence has yet to establish a clear biological func- tion for boron in humans. Although some evidence does suggest a role in the metabolism of vitamin D and estrogen, further research is necessary.

Silicon	Note	A functional role for silicon in humans has not yet been identified, although animal studies show that silicon may be involved in the formation of bone.

Arsenic -- Note -- There have been no studies performed to determine the nutritional importance of arsenic for humans. Animal studies suggest a role for arsenic in the metabolism of methionine, in growth and reproduction, and in gene expression.
Arsenic -- Note -- Data were insufficient to set a UL for arsenic. Although a UL was not determined for arsenic, there is no justification for adding it to food or supplements.
Arsenic -- Note -- Although no UL was set for arsenic, there may be a risk of adverse effects with the consumption of organic arsenic in food or with the intake of inorganic arsenic in water supplies at the current maximum contamination level of 50 mg/L, set in the United States.

Sulfate	Note	(special)

Carotenoids	Note	There are no DRIs specifically for carotenoids. The most prevalent carotenoids in North American diets are a-carotene, b-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-cryptoxanthin. Of these, a-carotene, b-carotene, and b- cryptoxanthin can be converted into retinol (vitamin A) in the body and are called provitamin A carotenoids. Lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin have no vi- tamin A activity and are called nonprovitamin A carotenoids. The only known function of carotenoids in humans is to act as a source of vitamin A in the diet (provitamin A carotenoids only). Although epidemiological evidence suggests that higher blood concentrations of b-carotene and other carotenoids obtained from foods are associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases, other evidence suggests possible harm arising from very large doses in population subgroups, such as smokers and asbestos workers. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that a certain percentage of dietary vitamin A should come from provitamin A carot- enoids. However, existing recommendations calling for the increased consumption of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables for their health-promoting benefits are strongly supported.
Biotin	Note	* Biotin content has been documented for relatively few foods, and so it is gener- ally not included in food composition tables. Thus, intake tends to be underestimated in diets. Although biotin is widely distributed in natural foods, its con- centration significantly varies. For example, liver contains biotin at about 100 mg/100 g, whereas fruits and most meats contain only about 1 mg/100 g.
Vitamin B-12	Note	Considerations -- adult_50_up -- Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may malabsorb food-bound vitamin B12, for adults over 50 years old it is advisable for most of this amount to be obtained by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B12 or a vitamin B12-containng supplement.

Vitamin A	Note	Considerations: Vegetarian diets: Preformed vitamin A (retinol) is found only in animal-based foods. People who do not consume such foods must meet their requirements with foods that contain sufficient provitamin A carotenoids, such as deeply colored fruits and vegetables, or with fortified foods, such as margarine, some plant-based beverages, and cereals.
Vitamin A	Note	The UL for adults is based on liver abnormalities as the critical adverse effect; for women of childbearing age, the UL is based on teratogenicity as the critical adverse effect. High b-carotene in- takes have not been shown to cause hypervitaminosis A.
Vitamin A 	Typical Intake -- 95th percentile -- 2000 mg/day -- For U.S. adults who took supplements containing vitamin A, intakes at the 95th percentile ranged from approximately 1,500 to 3,000 mg/ day.
Vitamin A	Typical Intake -- Median -- 1,430 mg RAE/day -- NHANES III data, the median intake of vitamin A from supple- ments was approximately 1,430 mg RAE/day for men and wome

Vitamin A	Note	RAE = Retinol activity equivalent. 1 mg RAE = 1 mg retinol, 12 mg b-carotene, and 24 mg a-carotene or b-cryptoxanthin. The RAE for dietary provitamin A carotenoids in foods is twofold greater than retinol equivalents (RE), whereas the RAE for preformed vitamin A in foods is the same as RE.
Vitamin A	Note	The UL for vitamin A applies only to preformed vitamin A (e.g., retinol, the form of vitamin A found in animal foods, most fortified foods, and supplements). It does not apply to vitamin A derived from carotenoids.

Total Water -- Inadequate -- Inadequate water intake leads to dehydration

Total Water -- interaction -- Caffeine -- Due to its diuretic effect, caffeine in high amounts may lead to a total body water (TBW) deficit.
Total Water -- interaction -- Alcohol -- Alcohol intake appears to increase water excretion.
Total Water -- interaction -- Sodium -- Increased sodium intake may increase urine volume.
Total Water -- interaction -- Protein -- Increased protein consumption may increase water needs. Urea, a major end product of the metabolism of dietary proteins and amino acids, requires water for excretion by the kidneys.
Total Water -- interaction -- Fiber -- Fecal water loss is increased with increased dietary fiber.
Total Water -- interaction -- Carbohydrate -- The presence of dietary carbohydrates may decrease quantity of body solutes (ketone bodies) that need to be excreted

Total Water -- Typical Intake -- 99th percentile -- 8.1 L/day


Cholesterol	Note	Neither an EAR, RDA, nor AI was set for cholesterol. Because all tissues are capable of synthesizing enough cholesterol to meet their metabolic and structural needs, there is no evidence for a biological requirement for dietary cholesterol. It is recommended that people maintain their dietary cholesterol intake as low as possible, while consuming a diet nutritionally adequate in all required nutrients. The main adverse effect of dietary cholesterol is increased LDL cholesterol concentration, which could result in an increased risk of CHD. There is also increasing evidence that genetic factors underlie a substantial portion of the variation among individuals in response to dietary cholesterol. Although mixed, there is evidence that increases in serum cholesterol concen- tration due to dietary cholesterol are blunted by diets low in saturated fat, high in polyunsaturated fat, or both. No consistent significant associations have been established between dietary cholesterol intake and cancer, including lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers.

Excessive physical activity can lead to the following adverse effects:

• Overuse injuries: Too much or improper physical exercise can cause over- use injuries to muscles, bones, and joints, as well as injuries caused by accidents. In addition, pre-existing conditions can be aggravated by the initiation of a physical activity program. Activity-related injuries are of- ten avoidable but do occur and need to be resolved in the interest of long-term general health and short-term physical fitness.
• Dehydration and hyperthermia: Exercise may cause dehydration, which can be aggravated by environmental conditions that increase fluid losses, such as heat, humidity, and lack of wind. People should consume water before, during (if possible), and after exercise.
• Hypothermia: Hypothermia can result from water exposure and heat loss during winter sports. Poor choice of clothing during skiing, accidental water immersion due to a capsized boat, weather changes, or physical exhaustion may lead to the inability to generate adequate body heat to maintain core body temperature, which can lead to death, even when temperatures are above freezing.
• Cardiac events: Although regular physical activity promotes cardiovas- cular fitness, heavy physical exertion can trigger the development of arrhythmias or myocardial infarctions or, in some instances, can lead to sudden death.
• Female athlete triad: Athletic women who undereat or overtrain can de- velop a condition, or cluster of conditions, called the “female athlete triad.” In this triad, disordered eating and chronic energy deficits can lead to loss of menses, osteopenia, and premature osteoporosis, increas- ing the risk of hip, spine, and forearm fractures.


### Amino Acids p 149

The recommended amino acid scoring pattern for proteins for individuals aged 1 year and older and all other age groups is as shown (in mg/g of protein). This pattern allows comparison of the relative nutritional quality of different protein sources by calculating a pro- tein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). The calculation com- pares the amino acid in a test protein with the amount of that amino acid in the FNB/IOM scoring pattern multiplied by the true digestibility. Illustration of the calculation involved is detailed in Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohy- drate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (2005).

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein is

Protein		AMDR	child_14_18	10–30 percent of total calories
Protein		AMDR	adult_18_up	10–35 percent of total calories

* The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects for almost all people. Data were insufficient to establish a UL for total protein or for any of the amino acids.
* However, the absence of a UL warrants caution in using any single amino acid at levels significantly above those normally found in food.

* Given limited data, caution is warranted in using any single amino acid at a level significantly above that normally found in food.

INADEQUATE INTAKE AND DEFICIENCY: In Western urban societies, one particular concern is the long-term effect of a diet so low in carbohydrate that it induces a chronically increased produc- tion of keto acids. Such a diet may lead to bone mineral loss, hypercholester- olemia, increased risk of urolithiasis, and impaired development and function of the central nervous system. It also may adversely affect a person’s sense of well-being and fail to provide adequate glycogen stores. The latter is required for hypoglycemic emergencies and for maximal short-term power production by muscles.
ADVERSE EFFECTS OF OVERCONSUMPTION: Data are mixed on potential adverse effects of overconsuming carbohydrate (i.e., sugars and starches), which include dental caries, behavioral changes, can- cer, risk of obesity, and risk of hyperlipidemia. For more information on the association between carbohydrates and chronic disease, see Part II, “Macronu- trients, Healthful Diets, and Physical Activity.”

Fatty acids are the major constituents of triglycerides and fall into the following categories:

* **saturated fatty acids**
* **cis monounsaturated fatty acids**
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6**
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3**
* **trans fatty acids**

* **Monounsaturated fatty acids (n-9)** -- AI -- can be synthesized by the body and confer no known independent health benefits. Neither an EAR (and thus an RDA) nor an AI was set. Evidence was insufficient to set a UL for cis monounsaturated fatty acids.
* **Trans fatty acids** -- AI -- are not essential and confer no known health benefits. Therefore, no EAR (and thus an RDA) or AI was set. As with saturated fatty acids, there is a positive linear trend between trans fatty acid intake and LDL cholesterol concentration and therefore an increased risk of coronary heart dis- eases. It is recommended that individuals maintain their trans fatty acid con- sumption as low as possible without compromising the nutritional adequacy of their diet. Foods that contain trans fatty acids include traditional stick marga- rine and vegetable shortenings subjected to partial hydrogenation and various bakery products and fried foods prepared using partially hydrogenated oils. Milk, butter, and meats also contain trans fatty acids but at lower levels

* **Total Fat** -- Interactions -- fat aids in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K, and other food components, such as carotenoids.

* **Saturated fatty acids** -- No UL, but as low as possible while following a nutritionally adequate diet.
* **Trans fatty acids** -- No UL, but as low as possible while following a nutritionally adequate diet.
* **cis monounsaturated fatty acids** -- No UL
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6** -- No UL
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3** -- No UL

* **Total Fat** -- Inadequate -- In sedentary populations, such as those in the United States and Canada where overweight and obesity are common, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets induce changes in lipoprotein and glucose/insulin metabolism in ways that could raise the risk for chronic diseases. Available prospective studies have not concluded whether high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets present a health risk in the North American population. Imbalanced intake can also be of concern. Compared with higher fat diets, low-fat and high-carbohydrate diets may alter metabolism in a way that in- creases the risk of chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease and diabetes. These changes include a reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) choles- terol concentration, an increase in serum triacylglycerol concentration, and higher responses in glucose and insulin concentrations following food consumption. This metabolic pattern has been associated with an increased risk of CHD and Type II diabetes, although strong evidence does not exist that low-fat diets actu- ally predispose an individual to either CHD or diabetes.
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6** -- When n-6 fatty acid intake is inadequate or absorption is impaired, tissue concentrations of arachidonic acid decrease, inhibition of the desaturation of oleic acid is reduced, and synthesis of eicosatrienoic acid from oleic acid in- creases. A lack of dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is characterized by rough scaly skin, dermatitis, and an elevated eicosatrienoic acid:arachidonic acid (triene:tetraene) ratio.
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3** -- Inadequate -- A lack of a-linolenic acid in the diet can result in clinical symptoms of a defi- ciency (e.g., scaly dermatitis). Unlike essential fatty acid deficiency (of both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids), plasma eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 n-9) remains within nor- mal ranges, and skin atrophy and scaly dermatitis are absent when the diet is only deficient in n-3 fatty acids.
* **cis polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3** -- Benefits -- Because of their function, growing evidence suggests that dietary n-3 poly- unsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) may reduce the risk of many chronic diseases including CHD, stroke, and diabetes. For example, n-3 fatty acids may reduce CHD risk through a variety of mechanisms, such as by preventing arrhythmias, reducing atherosclerosis, decreasing platelet aggregation and plasma triacylglycerol concentration, slightly increasing HDL concentration, modulat- ing endothelial function, and decreasing proinflammatory eicosanoids.

### Cholesterol p 137

Cholesterol	Note	Neither an EAR, RDA, nor AI was set for cholesterol. Because all tissues are capable of synthesizing enough cholesterol to meet their metabolic and structural needs, there is no evidence for a biological requirement for dietary cholesterol. It is recommended that people maintain their dietary cholesterol intake as low as possible, while consuming a diet nutritionally adequate in all required nutrients. The main adverse effect of dietary cholesterol is increased LDL cholesterol concentration, which could result in an increased risk of CHD. There is also increasing evidence that genetic factors underlie a substantial portion of the variation among individuals in response to dietary cholesterol. Although mixed, there is evidence that increases in serum cholesterol concen- tration due to dietary cholesterol are blunted by diets low in saturated fat, high in polyunsaturated fat, or both. No consistent significant associations have been established between dietary cholesterol intake and cancer, including lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers.

* Active adults: Physical activity, particularly when performed in hot weather, increases daily fluid needs. Daily water requirements for adults can double in hot weather (86∞F or 30∞C) and triple in very hot weather (104∞F or 40∞C) to make up for water lost via sweating.
* Active children: Children who are active produce considerably less sweat than active adults, even when exercising in hot environments. This dif- ference in sweat production prevails until midpuberty and should be considered when determining the water requirements of active children and adolescents.
* Elderly: Hydration status continues to be normal in elderly individuals over a wide range of intakes. However, a deficit in thirst and fluid intake regulation, age-related impairments in renal-concentrating and sodium- conserving ability, prior history of stroke, or evidence of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction may contribute to increased incidence of dehy- dration and hypernatremia.

* People in very hot (e.g., desert) climates, who often have sweating rates of 0.3–1.2 L/hour while performing occupational activities
* People wearing protective clothing, who often have sweating rates of 1–2 L/hour while performing light-intensity exercise in hot weather
* Male competitive runners, who can have sweating rates of 1 to > 2 L/hour while training or racing in the heat
* Female competitive runners may increase their sweat losses from approximately 0.7 L/hour in temperate weather to approximately 1.1 L/hour in warm weather when performing the same event

* Diabetes mellitus: Dehydration is clearly associated with the worsening control of diabetes. In addition, uncontrolled diabetes dramatically contributes to de- velopment of severe dehydration and volume depletion due to osmotic diure- sis. In people with poorly controlled diabetes, reduced water intake can also lead to dehydration owing to infection or hypotension, which can lead to de- lirium and an impaired ability to seek water.
* Cystic fibrosis: People with cystic fibrosis have high concentrations of sodium chloride in their sweat. They may lose excessive amounts of sodium and chlo- ride when their sweating rates are high and, unlike healthy people, their body fluid osmolality does not increase due to the high concentrations of sodium chloride in their sweat. Without elevated serum osmolality, a major trigger for thirst, cystic fibrosis patients can quickly become dehydrated during physical activity, particularly in the heat.
* Diuretics and other medications: There are no medications that directly stimu- late water intake. When decreased fluid intake has occurred due to illness, medications that improve metabolic and cognitive function should indirectly help people increase their fluid intake. Examples include antibiotics for infec- tions, insulin for unstable diabetics, and analgesics for delirium-inducing pain. However, some drugs, such as diuretics, cause excess water loss. Diuretics are commonly used medications that are prescribed for the treatment of condi- tions such as hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Dehy- dration may occur in people who do not modify their use of diuretics in hot weather or in other situations where excess water loss occurs. Other medica- tions, such as lithium, may interfere with the kidneys’ regulatory systems, lead- ing to excessive water loss.

Because healthy individuals have considerable ability to excrete excess water and thereby maintain water balance, a UL was not set for water. However, acute water toxicity has been reported from the rapid consumption of large quantities of fluids that greatly exceeded the kidneys’ maximal excretion rate of approxi- mately 0.7–1.0 L/hour.
No adverse intakes have been reported with chronic high intakes of water in health people consuming a normal diet, as long as fluid intake is approximately proportional to losses.

Total Water -- Inadequate -- Inadequate water intake leads to dehydration

Total Water -- interaction -- Caffeine -- Due to its diuretic effect, caffeine in high amounts may lead to a total body water (TBW) deficit.
Total Water -- interaction -- Alcohol -- Alcohol intake appears to increase water excretion.
Total Water -- interaction -- Sodium -- Increased sodium intake may increase urine volume.
Total Water -- interaction -- Protein -- Increased protein consumption may increase water needs. Urea, a major end product of the metabolism of dietary proteins and amino acids, requires water for excretion by the kidneys.
Total Water -- interaction -- Fiber -- Fecal water loss is increased with increased dietary fiber.
Total Water -- interaction -- Carbohydrate -- The presence of dietary carbohydrates may decrease quantity of body solutes (ketone bodies) that need to be excreted

Total Water -- Typical Intake -- 99th percentile -- 8.1 L/day

### Vitamin A p 171

* RAE = Retinol activity equivalent. 1 mg RAE = 1 mg retinol, 12 mg b-carotene, and 24 mg a-carotene or b-cryptoxanthin. The RAE for dietary provitamin A carotenoids in foods is twofold greater than retinol equivalents (RE), whereas the RAE for preformed vitamin A in foods is the same as RE.
* The UL for vitamin A applies only to preformed vitamin A (e.g., retinol, the form of vitamin A found in animal foods, most fortified foods, and supplements). It does not apply to vitamin A derived from carotenoids.

Vitamin A	Note	Considerations: Vegetarian diets: Preformed vitamin A (retinol) is found only in animal-based foods. People who do not consume such foods must meet their requirements with foods that contain sufficient provitamin A carotenoids, such as deeply colored fruits and vegetables, or with fortified foods, such as margarine, some plant-based beverages, and cereals.
Vitamin A	Note	The UL for adults is based on liver abnormalities as the critical adverse effect; for women of childbearing age, the UL is based on teratogenicity as the critical adverse effect. High b-carotene in- takes have not been shown to cause hypervitaminosis A.
Vitamin A 	Typical Intake -- 95th percentile -- 2000 mg/day -- For U.S. adults who took supplements containing vitamin A, intakes at the 95th percentile ranged from approximately 1,500 to 3,000 mg/ day.

* Biotin content has been documented for relatively few foods, and so it is gener- ally not included in food composition tables. Thus, intake tends to be underestimated in diets. Although biotin is widely distributed in natural foods, its con- centration significantly varies. For example, liver contains biotin at about 100 mg/100 g, whereas fruits and most meats contain only about 1 mg/100 g.

### CAROTENOIDS p 212

There are no DRIs specifically for carotenoids. The most prevalent carotenoids in North American diets are a-carotene, b-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-cryptoxanthin. Of these, a-carotene, b-carotene, and b- cryptoxanthin can be converted into retinol (vitamin A) in the body and are called provitamin A carotenoids. Lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin have no vi- tamin A activity and are called nonprovitamin A carotenoids. The only known function of carotenoids in humans is to act as a source of vitamin A in the diet (provitamin A carotenoids only). Although epidemiological evidence suggests that higher blood concentrations of b-carotene and other carotenoids obtained from foods are associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases, other evidence suggests possible harm arising from very large doses in population subgroups, such as smokers and asbestos workers. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that a certain percentage of dietary vitamin A should come from provitamin A carot- enoids. However, existing recommendations calling for the increased consumption of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables for their health-promoting benefits are strongly supported.
